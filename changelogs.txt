v0.1.6 - 20130929
-----------------
Fixes #1 : Access token refresh fails on IE10
Applied a temporary pseudo fix until IE is patched.

v0.1.5 - 20130919
-----------------
The listener exposes a new method : trigger(actionKey: string): boolean

This allows you to manually trigger a gameEvent, passing it an actionKey, directly from the listener.
Previously, if you wanted to manually trigger a gameEvent, you had to use the singleton
eventAggregator instance (pubSub). This forced you to keep a reference to the pubSub.


v0.1.4 - 20130912
-----------------

* Easier game notification dispatching system.

In the previous versions, to handle game notifications received after an api call, you had to register a callback on the onGameNotification event/method.
Your callback had to implement the dispatch process, parsing the notification and routing it according to its type.

To simplify this process, the listener is now exposing 1 event/method for each type of notification you could received from the gamification engine.

onLevelChanged
onPointReceived
onCurrencyReceived
onAchievementReceived
onGoodReceived

You can still use onGameNotification if you prefer to use your own implementation.
